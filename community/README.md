# Community Roles
Submit your own roles to this folder!

1. Create a pull request with your custom role and submit it to this foler.
2. A moderator will look at your submission and tell you if there is something wrong with it.
3. Your submission will be added to a fine selection of roles to choose from.

## Rules
If your submission contains any harmful, sexual or copyrighted content of any kind, it will be deleted.

## Content
Don't use special chars in your role names (allowed in `displayName`, `title` and `description`). It sure works, but it doesn't look nice.
